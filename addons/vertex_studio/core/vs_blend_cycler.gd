## Drop-on ready to use componente/node for runtime variation blending. Add it under a MeshInstance3D
## that has a [VSRuntime] (or under the VSRuntime itself) and press play: it
## finds the mesh's variations on its own and keeps blending between them.[br]
## [br]
## It's also a reference for driving the runtime from your own scripts:
## everything it does goes through the public [VSRuntime] API
## ([method VSRuntime.set_active_snapshot], [method VSRuntime.tween_to_snapshot],
## [method VSRuntime.tween_to_snapshot_cpu], [signal VSRuntime.snapshot_blend_finished]).[br]
## [br]
## Blending is EXPERIMENTAL.

## What the cycle does: walk every variation in order, looping (CYCLE_ALL), or
## bounce between two of them (PING_PONG, endpoints in the Ping Pong group).
